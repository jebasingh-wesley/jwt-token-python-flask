     ```

## Usage

1. **MongoDB Setup**
   - Complete the MongoDB setup as described in `mongodb_install_document.txt`.

2. **JWT Authentication**
   - Review and modify `rasat_jwt.py` as needed for your application.
   - Use the provided functions to handle JWT generation and verification.

## Example

Here's a basic usage example for `rasat_jwt.py`:

```python
from rasat_jwt import generate_jwt, verify_jwt
